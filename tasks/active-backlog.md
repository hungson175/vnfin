# vnfin-oss — Active Backlog

Operating discipline (Boss 2026-06-19): git history is the progress tracker (commit often);
every reviewer/poller task lands here FIRST, then is processed and removed/marked done with a
commit/issue ref. See `/tmp/vnfin-operating-protocol-202606190959.md`.

Goal (Boss 2026-06-19): work closely with vnfin-oss-reviewer to fix **ALL** GitHub issues/bugs.

Flow per item: design → discuss+converge with reviewer → TDD red-first → green (full suite +
public-API + docs-contract + cov ≥85%) → commit → reviewer code review → push to master →
close issue → advance watermark → mark Done here.
