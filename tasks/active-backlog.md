# vnfin-oss — Active Backlog

Operating discipline (Boss 2026-06-19): git history is the progress tracker (commit often);
every reviewer/poller task lands here FIRST, then is processed and removed/marked done with a
commit/issue ref. See `/tmp/vnfin-operating-protocol-202606190959.md`.

Goal (Boss 2026-06-19, updated ~18:01): **REFACTOR FIRST** — provider-boundary + typed-result
contract refactor (`tasks/refactor-provider-contracts.md`), working with vnfin-oss-reviewer per
phase. GitHub bug fixing is PAUSED (log only) until the contract foundation (Phase 1–2) lands.

Flow per item: design → discuss+converge with reviewer → TDD red-first → green (full suite +
public-API + docs-contract + cov ≥85%) → commit → reviewer code review → push to master →
close issue → advance watermark → mark Done here.

## ⏸️ REFACTOR MODE — Boss directive 2026-06-19 ~18:01: refactoring is first priority

**GitHub bug fixing is PAUSED** — log new bugs to "Paused bugs — after refactor" below; do NOT
fix/push/close until the contract-refactor foundation (Phase 1–2) lands.

- **Active work:** provider-boundary + typed-result **contract refactor** — see
  `tasks/refactor-provider-contracts.md` (plan from reviewer review-202606191803). Phase 0 docs in
  progress → request reviewer Checkpoint A / pre-Phase-1 design review before coding.
- **Safe checkpoint:** code tree CLEAN at `5c05566` (last reviewed+pushed; 0 open bugs; suite
  green). Nothing pushed/closed.

## Paused bugs — after refactor

- **#93** (parked, poller 18:20) — OpenER required VND anchor non-finite values should fail closed
  as InvalidData, not EmptyData. Fix in **Phase 4 FX** adapter migration.
- **#30** (parked, poller 18:25) — index constituent `stockSymbol` must be a canonical security
  identifier (reject internal space/slash/punctuation/newline), not just non-empty. Fix in
  **Phase 4 indices/security-identifier** migration.
- **#142** (parked, poller 18:35) — see review-202606191841; fix in the relevant Phase 4 adapter
  migration. Do not fix now.
- **#32** (parked, poller 18:35) — see review-202606191841; fix in the relevant Phase 4 adapter
  migration. Do not fix now.
- **#143 / #48** (parked, poller 18:45) — see review-202606191849; fix in the relevant Phase 4
  adapter migration. Do not fix now.
- **#44 / #45 / #21 / #26 fundamentals provider-shape hardening** — addressed by the Phase 2
  contract migration (`ec69a1e`); to be CLOSED in Phase 6 after Checkpoint C approves. WIP stash
  `git stash@{0}` superseded (reference only). Original handoff:
  `/tmp/vnfin-wip-handoff-44-45-21-26-202606191803.md`.
- **(historical stash note)** — WIP stash: `git stash@{0}`
  ("WIP paused: #44/#45/#21/#26 ..."); handoff `/tmp/vnfin-wip-handoff-44-45-21-26-202606191803.md`.
  Partial+untested (#44/#45/#21 key-presence guards; #26 `canonical_item_code` helper unwired).
  All four issues OPEN. **Do NOT fix until the refactor contract foundation lands** — Phase 2 will
  handle them via migration, Phase 6 closes them. Do not apply the stash before then.
- **#140 — "financial news" enhancement** — parked (product/scope, not a bug).

## Review blockers (reviewer BLOCK/P1 waiting for fix)

- _(none)_

## Poller triage (newly triaged)

- **#140 — "financial news" FEATURE request** (enhancement label). NOT a bug → Boss/product-scope
  decision; parked (reviewer agrees, like #137). Not implementing autonomously.

## Next

- _(none)_

## Non-blocking follow-ups (only if Boss/reviewer prioritizes — NOT open issues)

- #69: `quote_asset=None` + a normalized (currency-form) `price_unit` is currently accepted;
  a stricter "quote_asset mandatory" policy would be a separate follow-up (reviewer note 14:21).
- #130: `model_type` allow-list is fixed to {1,2,3,101,102,103}; widen only if an official set is documented.
- #133: no accepted-exchange set / provider_symbol contradiction rule yet (deferred until a
  provider-symbol mapping is defined).
- #116: `_QTY` left boundary allows a digit glued to a letter (`ABC5 LUONG`) — revisit if such names appear.
- #124: crypto bar `time` checked tz-aware only, not exact UTC offset — future tightening.

## 🎉 Milestone: 43-issue backlog fully cleared (2026-06-19)

Open count 43 → 0 in one session. ~21 were verified already-fixed (closed with cited passing
tests, reviewer-validated); the rest were real TDD fixes (BTMC cluster #113/#114/#116/#117/#118;
then #111/#119/#121/#120/#68/#28/#108/#21/#66), each reviewer-approved and pushed to master.
