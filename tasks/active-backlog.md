# vnfin-oss — Active Backlog

Operating discipline (Boss 2026-06-19): git history is the progress tracker (commit often);
every reviewer/poller task lands here FIRST, then is processed and removed/marked done with a
commit/issue ref. See `/tmp/vnfin-operating-protocol-202606190959.md`.

Goal (Boss 2026-06-19): work closely with vnfin-oss-reviewer to fix **ALL** GitHub issues/bugs.

Flow per item: design → discuss+converge with reviewer → TDD red-first → green (full suite +
public-API + docs-contract + cov ≥85%) → commit → reviewer code review → push to master →
close issue → advance watermark → mark Done here.

## Now (WIP — max 1–2)

- **Gap fixes** — verification sweep complete (43→12 open). Remaining 12 are genuine gaps.
  Classify each by writing a failing test first (red = code gap → fix; green = test-only gap →
  add test). Test-gaps (guard present): #26 CafeF dup, #49 FRED inverted-window, #65 direct-source
  caller-input, #68 fmarket case-insensitive dup. Code-gaps: #21 WorldBank/DBnomics identity,
  #28 Vietcombank currency codes, #66 crypto/stooq dup-key, #108 WorldBank/IMF strict year,
  #111 VNDirect type-before-truthiness, #119 CafeF Success bool, #120 fractional volume,
  #121 VNDirect modelType coercion. (#119/#120/#121 newest — likely real code gaps.)

## Review blockers (reviewer BLOCK/P1 waiting for fix)

- _(none)_

## Poller triage (newly triaged)

- _(none pending)_

## Next (the only remaining open bugs — all 12 are in the Now gap-fix queue above)

_All other backlog items verified-fixed and closed during the 2026-06-19 sweep (43→12 open)._
